# WeConnect_improvised

For this project of Social Networking, I used MERN stack for building it from scratch i.e., 
M = MongoDB for database
E = Express.js web framework
R = React.js for frontend development
N = Node.js for backend

The project is deployed in our [localhost:3000]localhost:3000. 
The backend part is deployed in [localhost:5000]localhost:5000 and the frontend in [localhost:3000]localhost:3000.
